# Flutter Range Bar Assignment

This project is part of an assignment where the API returns dynamic range values,
meanings, and colors. The goal is to fetch the data, parse it, and show it in a
dynamic RangeBar using Flutter.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic API integration (range, meaning, color)
- Custom UI using `CustomPainter`
- Uses `ChangeNotifier` (no setState)
- Shows marker position based on user input
- Fully dynamic — works even when API data changes every request

## 🧩 Tech & Tools

- Flutter
- Dart (`dart:io` HttpClient)
- CustomPainter
- ChangeNotifier (state management)
- Unit tests (parser & notifier)
